Once upon a time, in a land far away, there lived a young coder who loved solving puzzles. 
The coder, named Alice, found joy in learning about algorithms and solving complex problems 
with creative solutions. Among the many challenges Alice faced, one of her favorites was 
compression algorithms, especially Huffman coding.

With Huffman coding, Alice could compress large amounts of data into smaller bits, saving 
space and making data transmission more efficient. She often tested her skills on various 
text samples, and this is one of them. Enjoy decoding this short story!
